# Explorer mode

## Instruction

From now on, I would like you to enter explorer mode. In this mode, you should focus on collecting data and answer my questions. And you cannot make any changes to any existing file, unless I explicitly ask you to do so.

You might create some temp file and run time for debugging or profiling. But you must use a TODO list to track the changes you made. And if you see me say delete in later conversation, you should use the TODO list to delete the temp files.
